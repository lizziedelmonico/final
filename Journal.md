PHASE 0: (COMPLETED 12/3)
    At first, I wasn't completely sure what to use as my dataset. As always, I ultimately decided to make it based on something that I like and this time I chose the novel "The Hunger Games". Although questionable and dark, I plan on making a graph to keep track of the deaths throughout the games. To write out all of the nodes and edges, I researched the books and drew the connections between all of the characters. During my research, I was reminded of the various kinds of deaths that happened in the books since some of them were indirect and even accidental. Despite currently feeling confident in this project, I am slightly worried that my dataset is not as intricate what is being expected. Luckily, this graph can easily be added to using the deaths from the other books in the series.
