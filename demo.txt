To run the program, click "Run" while on UserDisplay.java class. From there, you will find the title screen, as shown in the screenshot.png 
file. For the best graphics, put the output on full screen mode. While typing in tributes' names, capitalize the first letter and leave the
rest undercase. After you've typed in the names, click enter to get the results. If you cannot think of any tributes' names, you can look at
the game results for some examples!
